# OpenWRT-Backup

A simple backup tool that automates the process of backing up OpenWRT to Minio.

# Features 

- Written without AI.
- It uses the Gnome keyring to retrieve passwords from the OS at runtime, so there's no hardcoded credentials.
- It can be easily edited to run in headless mode.
- It prints the steps it is taking along the way.

I'll probably make this script a little cleaner and add some argparse options and better error handling, but for now it works fine for my needs.

Enjoy!
